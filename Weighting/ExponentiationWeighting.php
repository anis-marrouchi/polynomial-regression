/**
 * This class will weight the terms for the regression by raising the index of the term to
 * a given power.  When the power term is positive this means those indices at the end will
 * command more of the outcome than those at the beginning.  The reverse is true for negative
 * powers.  A power of 0 has no effect and all terms are weighted equally.
 *
 * NOTE: Does not use BC math.  This is done so the weighting power can be fractional which
 * is not supported by BC math.  Because BC math isn't use the useful range of this class is
 * limited.
